Detailed report on dataset of  Car prdiction Document.

 what I found 

1. The dataset is loaded from a Google Sheets link(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FHmYNLs9v0Enc-UExEMpitOFGsWvB2dP/view?usp=drive_link) and contains car details such as Car name, car_ID  , fueltype , carbody, etc

2. Tne objective of this analysis to identify the significant features affecting car prices and build regression models to predict car prices.
3. Models implemented

Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor,Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

The best performing model is Random forest regressor , R2 score having an increase to 0.94 after tuning.

The most influential features are enginesize, curb weight, horsepower, carwidth, highwaympg 

Hyper parameter tuning have significant improvement in model performance.

Final model can help stakeholders understand pricing and design decisions for entering a new market.
